# BlueCloud Research

A compact reference for the exploratory and prototype work behind the Parviflo project. The notebooks document the data collection process, exploratory analysis, and the live MVP used for demonstrations.

## Repository layout
- **Correlations/** – Notebooks focused on exploratory statistics and correlation studies of the extracted datasets.
- **DataExploration/** – First-pass notebooks for sourcing, cleaning, and visualising raw data.
- **data/** – Shared source data pulled from open datasets (CSV, JSON, and other formats) used by the notebooks.
- **SavedImages/** – Exported plots and figures generated during analysis.
- **Parviflo_MVP.ipynb** – Prototype MVP backed by demo data for quick testing or presentations.
- **Parviflo_Live.ipynb** – Production-leaning MVP wired to live data sources.

## Environment setup

Install the Python dependencies before opening the notebooks:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
